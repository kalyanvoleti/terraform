# 📁 terraform-resources (Sandbox Branch)

This branch is dedicated to **hands-on practice and experimentation** with Terraform configurations.  
The `sandbox` branch provides a flexible space to create, modify, and test Terraform configurations without affecting the stable versions in the main branch.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The sandbox branch serves as a workspace to:

- Reinforce Terraform concepts through repeated practice  
- Experiment with variables, locals, conditionals, iteration, data sources, state management, provisioners, and EC2 resources  
- Test new ideas, configurations, or patterns before finalizing them in the main branch

---

## 📁 Usage

- Files in this branch are **frequently updated**  
- Some configurations may be **incomplete or experimental**  
- Intended solely as a **learning and testing environment**

---

## 📎 Note

Refer to the `main` branch for **stable, finalized, and portfolio-ready configurations**.  
The sandbox branch exists to support ongoing experimentation and skill development.
